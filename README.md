## üîß What It Does

This script automatically **removes unoccupied NPC vehicles** inside predefined polygon zones.  
It **protects player-owned vehicles** by checking their plates against your SQL vehicle table.

Use it to:
- Reduce unnecessary vehicle clutter in specific areas (e.g., city center, parking lots).
- Automatically control spawn-heavy zones.
- Improve performance and realism without deleting player assets.
